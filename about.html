        <h1> About Us</h1>
        <p>As long as you are a hopefull South African or reside within the country this school is yours as well. Started out as initiative to help pupils from the disadvantaged backgrounds to reach their full potentail and also being given a chance to dream like the kids from the previously privileged background. Our goal was and still is to bridge that gap and our school being situated at the heart of Cape Town. Within the its first 10 year period it has been having a pass rate of 100% except for 2020 calender that which may have been caused by the globl pandemic that surfaced in our beautiful country in March 2020. We have since then been working on regsaining that status again and also to cement our position in the top 100 academically performoing schools in South Africa with huge help from everyone involved especially our teachers and learners who take full responsibility in their respective roles. <br> <br> Not only our schools are off academic excellence but our presence is also immensely felt in the sporting and recreatonal departments and having fed atleast one child to the national senior soccer,cricket and rugby team since its existence and many around domestic leagues with the country and quite a huge fraction of that being sent to teams overseas. This would not sound right without mentioning 4 of our alumnus Siya Kolisi, Cheslyn Kolbe, Lukahnyo Am and Faf De Klerk who went on to win the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan anjd having being the gradutes of our resident coach Mnr Willemse. <br><br> Kasi School is the 3 medium school that is English being the first language and Afrikaans and IsiXhosa being thre additional languages. Having these 3 languages spoken in our schools would mean that we try by all possible means to making sure your child gets to a full potentials and our sports is as great as our academics. We have also done a lot for the south African music idnsutry as well and our proudest miment was when our school choir was alongside the Soweto Gospel choir and collaborated with Shakira in the timeless Waka Waka song, the offical song of FIFA 2010 world cup, and only in 6 months to our existence. Many of our graudtes went on to further study music across the South Africn musical school and many are behind many hit soings heard on our radio today and classics </p>
